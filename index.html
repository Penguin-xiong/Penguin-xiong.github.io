            <h4>Thoughts Spilling onto the Web</h4>
            <p>I don't think that anyone on this Earth has ever had it easy, if so, they are probably not living life correctly. It took me a long time to build this mindset but... I am not going to quit, never, no, not ever! Before I leave this Earth, there is something that I still have to show the world. I have envisioned it perfectly in my mind, and if only I could turn you into a thought, you'd be a guess in my mind and see my life's dream. Maybe then you'd sail with me to this utopian land.   <br> <br>
            I wonder if it is true. That we are all made up of light, existing in different frequencies yet bound together in this physical world. Sometimes when I see people, plants, or things--maybe I am just staring for too long--but it's almost as if the air around them start to glow. It could be a trick with the fluorescent/sun, but then again, maybe we really are all made up of light. Maybe some moments are just meant to be ours and we shine, literally.  <br><br> 
            "As I wandered through the deserted avenues, the mournful rustle of leaves beneath my feet seemed to echo the desolate emptiness within my soul. The once-verdant trees, now bare and skeletal, stood as silent sentinels, their branches reaching towards the inky heavens. The sun, a feeble orb, cast long, ominous shadows that seemed to dance and writhe in the deepening gloom."  <br>

            "The crisp, invigorating air carries the sweet scent of fallen leaves and the distant aroma of wood smoke from cozy fireplaces. The sun, casting long, dancing shadows, paints the city streets with a warm, golden glow. As the day draws to a close, the sky is ablaze with the fiery colors of a stunning sunset, a breathtaking spectacle that fills the heart with a sense of wonder and awe."<br>
