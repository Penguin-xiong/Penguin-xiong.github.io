        <p>This is a little about me. <br> <br>
        I workout sometimes at the fitness center. My siblings are gym rats, and I would like to be as strong as them. On my free time, I would code, so I decided to challange myself. That is how I ended up at FVTC. This way I can test my capiabilities. Ironically, I find that learning how to use software is the most challanging part of grabbing a Software Development Associates: vs code, cs community, github, etc. You'll always find me on campus. I have joined 2 clubs and am an execuitive member of HSU. This is a way for me to stay connected to as many of the campus' rescources. <br> <br>
        Aside from school related topics, I really enjoy playing card games: Yu-Gi-Oh!, MTG, Dragon Ball Z Fusion, etc. Sitting across from someone and trying to read their play is incredibility exciting. Everyday I have to excercise otherwise my body would hate me for not moving. My favitite sport is definatly tennis. I wish that I had a partner to go back and fourth with. That way, I could sharpen my skills. I love the movies and $5 Tuesdays--or however much it is now-- has to be the best invention since sliced bread. I kept up with most of the Marvel movies that lead up to Avengers End Game. Would like to continue keeping up with the MCU, but the writting has definatly gone down hill significantly. <br><br> 
        Keeping the mind sharp is just as important as entertainmen. A few random books that I have read are sheet music books. The kind that contains nursery rhymes or a simplified famous composition. Growing up, The Magic Tree House was a favitite of mine. Mary pope Osborne was certainly on of my Elementary School heros. Going to Middle School A Series of Unfortunate Events caught me with Lemony Snicket's creative writing. Lately, I have been diving into anchient scriptures. I finished reading The Emerald Tablets of Thoth this summer and wonder if somewhere on this planet is a burried spaceship undernearth a massive monolith.   </p>
