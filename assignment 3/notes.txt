Fetching a Random Pokemon:

getRandomPokemon is an asynchronous function that:
Picks a random number between 1 and 151.
Creates a URL to fetch a Pokemon with that ID from the PokeAPI.
Fetches the data from the API.
Parses the JSON response and returns the Pokemon data.
Displaying the Pokemon:

renderPokemon is a function that:
Takes the Pokemon data as input.
Creates an image element.
Sets the image source to the Pokemon's front sprite URL.
Sets the image's alternative text to the Pokemon's name.
Appends the image to the HTML element with the ID "pokemon-container".
Putting It Together:

The getRandomPokemon function is called.
Once the Pokemon data is fetched, it's passed to the renderPokemon function.
The renderPokemon function displays the Pokemon image on the page.
In simpler terms:

We ask the PokeAPI for a random Pokemon.
We get the information about that Pokemon.
We display a picture of that Pokemon on the webpage.
That's essentially what the code does. It's a great example of how to fetch data from an API and display it on a webpage using JavaScript.
